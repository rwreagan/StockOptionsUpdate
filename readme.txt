StockOptionsUpdate is a program that collects trading data for the stock and options markets on a daily basis for use in a private trading algorithm.

Daily trading data can be purchased from various sources, or it can be collected at no charge from the finance.yahoo.com api.  The data must be collected on each trading day, as the API does not offer historical data.
